# dotfiles

## Getting Started

Clone this repository into `~/dotfiles`. Install the dependencies below and run `stow .`. You may need to delete some lines from `.zshrc` if you aren't using certain software (e.g., `nvm`, `golang`, or `ghcup`). Once your `.zshrc` loads without fail, run `sourcetmux` to load tmux plugins, and open Neovim (`nvim`) to ensure everything works.
